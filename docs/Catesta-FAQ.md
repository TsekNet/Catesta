## FAQs

### How do I display the badges for my project?

Badge examples:

* ![AWS CodeBuild Status](https://codebuild.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/badges?uuid=eyJlbmNyeXB0ZWREYXRhIjoiTXdycWF3WnM4ME5Td21NVTI4bnRkS0hYMTF5aUxWUmNLNmNMc3Uyck5QZ29XNDRHZUFlaTc5Vk5vbHBVd3JOaTU1ZCtkRU5BSnYrdmlIWGhGbEEyVmhJPSIsIml2UGFyYW1ldGVyU3BlYyI6IlN5Qmx4WWovSUhtbyt3aUYiLCJtYXRlcmlhbFNldFNlcmlhbCI6MX0%3D&branch=master)
  * *There is a Copy badge URL on your Build project page*
* [![GitHub Actions Build Status Windows pwsh Master](https://github.com/techthoughts2/Catesta/workflows/Catesta-Windows-pwsh/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/techthoughts2/Catesta/actions)
  * *Just replace the link with your repo*
* [![AppVeyor Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kech4dkqsrb9xuet/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/techthoughts2/appveyortest/branch/master)
  * *Under ProjectName - Settings - Badges*
* [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/TechThoughts2/AzureTest/_apis/build/status/techthoughts2.AzureTest?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/TechThoughts2/AzureTest/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)
  * *Found under DevOps Project - Pipelines - Builds - ... - Status Badge*
  * Unfortunately by default badge access is restricted to only authenticated access. This can be disabled at the organization and project level if you wish to display on a GitHub repo:
    * *Organization Settings - Settings - Disable anonymous access to badge*
    * *Project Settings - Settings - Disable anonymous access to badge*

### I created a fresh project and my build process is already showing a failure

By default a freshly created module already violates one PSScriptAnalyzer rule:

*PSUseToExportFieldsInManifest - Do not use wildcard or $null in this field.*

So, if you commit a freshly created Catesta project - this is normal, and the build / test validation process is doing it's job. You'll need to correct your manifest to not use wildcards.

Typical error seen in build process:

```
===============================================================================
Task /./Analyze : Invokes PSScriptAnalyzer against the Module source path

### How does Catesta handle help creation?

Catesta leverages [platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) for external help creation.

The *source of truth* for all help in your project is derived from the comment base help in your public functions.
  * Functions located inside your public folder.

During the help generation process your functions in the public folders are evaluated and the comment based help is used to create markdown files using [platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS). Once these markdown files are created, platyPS is used again to craft an external xml based help filed (common for PowerShell use).

During the build process all functions are combined into the .psm1. All comment based help is stripped at this time and replaced with a reference to the external xml file.

Your comment based help continues to persist in your public functions folder and remains the source of truth. If help is updated or changed, it will be updated on the next build that you run in the same fashion.

Help workflow:

Craft excellent comment based help -> Run build -> markdown files generated -> xml file generated from markdown -> functions combined to psm1 -> comment based help stripped in psm1 and replaced with reference to external xml file -> parent level markdown docs updated for easy documentation reading in markdown on your repo.
